;;; Exercises

;;; Ex 13.1
;;; Write a function called SUBPROP that deletes an element from a set stored under a property name. 
;;; For example, if the symbol ALPHA has the list (A B C D E) as the value of its FOOPROP property, doing (SUBPROP 'ALPHA 'D 'FOOPROP) should leave (A B C E) as the value of ALPHA's FOOPROP property.
(setf (get 'alpha 'fooprop) '(a b c d e))

(defun subprop (name element prop)
  (setf (get name prop)
        (remove element
                (get name prop))))

;;; Ex 13.2
;;; Write a function called FORGET-MEETING that forgets that two particular persons have ever met each other.
;;; Use SUBPROP in your solution.
(defun addprop (sym elem prop)
  (pushnew elem (get sym prop)))

;;; Ex 13.3
;;; Using SYMBOL-PLIST, write your own version of the GET function.
(defun my-get (symbol property)
  (do ((p (symbol-plist symbol) (cddr p)))
      ((null p) nil)
    (if (equal property (first p))
        (return (second p)))))


;;; Ex 13.4
;;; Write a predicate HASPROP that returns T or NIL to indicate whether a symbol has a particular property, independent of the value of that property.
;;; Note: If symbol A has a property FOO with value NIL, (HASPROP 'A 'FOO) should still return T.
(defun hasprop (symbol property)

;;; Ex 13.8
;;;  Follow the steps below to create a histogram-drawing program. Your functions should not assume that the histogram will have exactly eleven bins.
;;; In other words, don't use eleven as a constant in you program; use (LENGTH *HIST-ARRAY*) instead.
;;; That way your program will be able to generate histograms of any size.

;;; a.
;;; Write expressions to set up a global variable *HIST-ARRAY* that holds the array of counts, and a global variable *TOTAL-POINTS* that holds the number of points recorded so far.
(setf *hist-array* nil)

;;; c.
;;; Write the function RECORD-VALUE that takes a number as input.
;;; If the number is between zero and ten, it should increment the appropriate element of the array, and also update *TOTAL-POINTS*.
;;; If the input is out of range, RECORD-VALUE should issue an appropriate error message.

      (incf (aref *hist-array* v))
      (error "Value ~S out of bounds." v)))

;;; d.
;;; Write a function PRINT-HIST-LINE that takes a value from zero to ten as input, looks up that value in the array, and prints the corresponding line of the histogram.
;;; To get the numbers to line up in columns properly, you will need to use the format directives ~2S to display the value and ~3S to display the count. 
;;; You can use a DOTIMES to print the asterisks.

;;; Set up the global variable CRYPTO-TEXT as shown. Then build the cryptogram-solvÂ§ing tool by following these instruction:

;;; a.

;;; As we solve the cryptogram we will store this information in two hash tables called *ENCIPHER-TABLE* and *DECIPHER-TABLE*.
;;; We will use *DECIPHER-TABLE* to print out the deciphered cryptogram.
;;; We need *ENCIPHER-TABLE* to check for two letters being deciphered to the same thing, for example, if P is deciphered to A and then we tried to decipher K to A, a look at *ENCIPHER-TABLE* would reveal that A had already been assigned to P.
;;; Similarly, if P is deciphered to A and then we tried deciphering P to E, a look at *DECIPHER-TABLE* would tell us that P had already been deciphered to A.

;;; Write a function MAKE-SUBSTITUTION that takes two character objects as input and stores the appropriate entries in *DECIPHER-TABLE* and *ENCIPHER-TABLE* so that the first letter deciphers to the second and the second letter enciphers to the first.

;;; Write a function DECIPHER-STRING that takes a single encoded string as input and return a new, partially decoded string. It should begin by making a new string the same length as the input, containing all spaces.
;;; Here is how to do that, assuming the variable LEN holds the length: (make-string len :initial-element #\Space).
;;; Next the function should iterate through the elements of the input string, which are character objects. For each character that deciphers to something non-NIL, that value should be inserted into the corresponding position in the new string.
